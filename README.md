# QUICKSILVER Targets

This repository holds target configurations for the [QUICKSILVER Flight Controller Firmware](https://github.com/BossHobby/QUICKSILVER)

See the folder `targets` for existing targets.
The folder `staging` holds targets converted from the [Betaflight unified targets](https://github.com/betaflight/unified-targets/) as a starting point for creating new targets.
